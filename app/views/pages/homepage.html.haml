  %h1 Opera of the Future
  %p.intro.init-hide The Opera of the Future group at the MIT Media Lab explores concepts and techniques to help advance the future of musical composition, performance, learning, and expression. Through the design of new interfaces for both professional virtuosi and amateur music-lovers; the development of new techniques for interpreting and mapping expressive gesture; and the application of these technologies to innovative compositions and experiences; we seek to enhance music as a performance art, and to develop its transformative power as a counterpoint to our everyday lives. The scope of our research includes musical instrument design, concepts for new performance spaces, interactive touring and permanent installations, and “music toys”, and ranges from an extension of traditional forms, to radical departures, such as the Brain Opera, Toy Symphony, and Death and the Powers.
